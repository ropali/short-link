            <h3>How it works!</h3>
            <span>
              Simply speaking, a URL shortener is a tool that shortens long links and produces short ones containing several characters. Itâ€™s useful mainly for marketers who take care of social media or email marketing. Shorter links are easier to share than long, complex ones. What's more, if a link is too long and has too many strange characters, users may be afraid of clicking on it, cause they don't know what is hidden on the other side.

          </CardPanel>
        </Col>
        
      </Row>
    </div>
